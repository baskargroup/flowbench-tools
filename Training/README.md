# Training Script

## Overview

This script is designed to train a machine learning model using a specified dataset. It supports various configurations for the training process, including different model architectures, hyperparameters, and training settings. The script outputs the trained model, training logs, and evaluation metrics.

## Features

- Configurable model architecture
- Supports various datasets and data formats
- Adjustable hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs, etc.)
- Saves trained models and logs training process
- Evaluates model performance on validation/test data


## Residuals

We provide a script to calculate the integral of the momentum and continuity residuals using the NeuFEnet approach as explained in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.01601).


## Requirements
